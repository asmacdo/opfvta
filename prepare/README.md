# Prepare Scripts

As the data analysis of OPFVTA necessitates a number of base analyses to
be performed --- which can take more than a few hours (even on
high-powered machines) it is advisable to execute the scripts in this
directory ahead of the document compilation rather than at compile time.
The scripts in this directory generate data which compile-time scripts
(located under `../scripts`, relative to here) depend on.
