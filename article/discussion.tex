\section{Discussion}

We also confirm related findings from the rat model animal, indicating that dopaminergic opto-fMRI notably (though in our study not primarily) and unexpectedly elicits activation in the dorsal areas of the striatum \cite{Lohani2016}, which are more commonly associated with the substantia nigra dopaminergic system.
