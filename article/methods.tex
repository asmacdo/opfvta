\section{Methods}

\subsection{Animal Preparation}

VTA dopaminergic neurons were specifically targeted via optogenetic stimulation.
As shown in \cref{fig:og}, this entails a triple selection process.
Firstly, cells are selected based on gene expression (via a transgenic mouse strain), secondly the location is selected based on the injection site, and thirdly, activation is based on the overlap of the aforementioned selection steps with the irradiation volume covered by the optic fiber.

A mouse strain was chosen, which expresses Cre recombinase under the dopamine transporter (DAT) promoter \cite{dat}.
Transgenic construct presence was assessed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the Cre construct, using the forward primer ACCAGCCAGCTATCAACTCG and the reverse primer TTGCCCCTGTTTCACTATCC.
A total of \sessionpy{pytex_printonly('scripts/animals_tg.py')} transgenic animals and \sessionpy{pytex_printonly('scripts/animals_wt.py')} control wild type animals are included in the study.
The animal sample consisted of \py{pytex_printonly('scripts/sex.py')}, with a group average age of \py{pytex_printonly('scripts/age.py')} at the study onset.

The right VTA (\cref{fig:mbfs}, green contour) of the animals was injected with a recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) solution.
The vector delivered a plasmid containing a floxed channelrhodopsin and YFP construct:
pAAV-EF1a-double floxed-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE-HGHpA, gifted to a public repository by Karl Deisseroth (\href{https://www.addgene.org/20298/}{Addgene plasmid \#20298}).
Viral vectors and plasmids were produced by the Viral Vector Facility (VVF) of the Neuroscience Center Zurich (Zentrum für Neurowissenschaften Zürich, ZNZ).
The solution was prepared at a titer of \SI{5.7e12}{\vg\per\milli\litre} and volumes from
\sessionpy{boilerplate.report_bound('VirusInjectionProtocol_amount', 'minmax', '\micro\litre')}
were injected into the right VTA.

and were located \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter} right of the midline.
Construct expression was ascertained post mortem by fluorescent microscopy of formaldehyde fixed \SI{200}{\micro\metre} brain slices.

For optical stimulation, animals were fitted with an optic fiber implant ($\mathrm{l=\SI{4.7}{\milli\meter} \ d=\SI{400}{\micro\meter} \ NA=0.22}$) targeting the right VTA, at least two weeks before imaging.
Implant target coordinates ranged in the PA direction from
\sessionpy{boilerplate.report_bound('OrthogonalStereotacticTarget_posteroanterior', 'minmax', '\milli\meter')} (relative to bregma),
in depth from
\sessionpy{boilerplate.report_bound('OrthogonalStereotacticTarget_depth', 'minmax', '\milli\meter')} (relative to the skull),
and were located
\sessionpy{boilerplate.report_bound('OrthogonalStereotacticTarget_leftright', 'minmax', '\milli\meter')}
right of the midline.

For stimulation, an Omicron LuxX 488-60 laser (\SI{488}{\nano\meter}) was used, tuned to a power of \SI{30}{\milli\watt} at contact with the fiber implant, according to the protocols listed in \cref{tab:CogB,tab:CogBr,tab:CogBl,tab:CogBm,tab:CogMwf,tab:CogP,tab:JPogP}.
Stimulation protocols were delivered to the laser and recorded to disk via the COSplayer device \cite{cosplay}.
Animal physiology, preparation, and measurement metadata were tracked with the LabbookDB database framework \cite{ldb}.

\subsection{MR Acquisition}

Over the course of preparation and measurement, animals were provided a constant flow of air with an additional \SI{20}{\percent} $\mathrm{O_2}$ gas (yielding a total $\mathrm{O_2}$ concentration of \SI{\approx 36}{\percent}).
For animal preparation, anesthesia was induced with \SI{3}{\percent} isoflurane, and maintained at \SIrange{2}{3}{\percent} during preparation --- contingent on animal reflexes.
Animals were fixed to a heated MRI-compatible cradle via ear bars and a face mask equipped with a bite hook.
A subcutaneous (s.c.; right dorsal) and intravenous (i.v.; tail vein) infusion line were applied.
After animal fixation, a bolus of medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitor, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, UK) was delivered s.c. to a total dose of \SI{100}{\nano\gram\per\gram\per\BW} and the inhalation anesthetic was reduced to \SI{1.5}{\percent} isoflurane.
After a \SI{5}{\minute} interval, the inhalation anesthetic was set to \SI{0.5}{\percent} and medetomidine was continuously delivered at \SI{200}{\nano\gram\per\gram\per\BW\per\hour} for the duration of the experiment.
This anesthetic protocol is closely based on extensive research into animal preparation for fMRI \cite{Grandjean2014}.

All data were acquired with a Bruker Biospec system (\SI{7}{\tesla}, \SI{16}{\centi\meter} bore), and an in-house built transmit/receive surface coil, engineered to permit optic fiber implant protrusion.

Anatomical scans were acquired via a TurboRARE sequence, with a RARE factor of 8, an echo time (TE) of \SI{30}{\milli\second}, an inter-echo spacing of \SI{10}{\milli\second}, and a repetition time (TR) of \SI{2.95}{\second}.
Thirty adjacent (no slice gap) coronal slices were recorded with an nominal in-plane resolution of $\mathrm{\Delta x(\nu)=\Delta y(\phi)=\SI{75}{\micro\meter}}$, and a slice thickness of $\mathrm{\Delta z(t)=\SI{450}{\micro\meter}}$.

Functional scans were acquired with a gradient-echo EPI sequence, a flip angle of \SI{60}{\degree}, and $\mathrm{TR/TE = \SI{1000}{\milli\second}/\SI{5.9}{\milli\second}}$.
Thirty adjacent (no slice gap) coronal slices were recorded with an nominal in-plane resolution of $\mathrm{\Delta x(\nu)=\Delta y(\phi)=\SI{225}{\micro\meter}}$, and a slice thickness of $\mathrm{\Delta z(t)=\SI{450}{\micro\meter}}$.
Changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) are measured as a proxy of neuronal activity following the administration of an intravascular iron oxide nanoparticle based contrast agent (Endorem, Laboratoire Guebet SA, France).
The contrast agent ($\SI{30.24}{\micro\gram\per\gram\per\BW}$) is delivered as an i.v. bolus \SI{10}{\minute} prior to the fMRI data acquisition, to achieve a pseudo steady-state blood concentration.
This contrast is chosen to enable short echo-time imaging thereby minimizing artefacts caused by gradients in magnetic susceptibility.

\subsection{Preprocessing}

Data conversion from the proprietary ParaVision format was performed via the Bruker-to-BIDS repositing pipeline \cite{aowsis} of the SAMRI package (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{0.4}} \cite{samri}).
Following conversion, data was dummy-scan corrected, registered, and subject to controlled smoothing via the SAMRI registration workflow \cite{irsabi}.
As part of this processing, the first 10 volumes were discarded (automatically accounting for volumes excluded by the scanner software).
Registration was performed using the standard SAMRI mouse-brain-optimized parameter set for ANTs \cite{ants} (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{2.3.1}}).
Data was transformed to a stereotactically oriented standard space (the DSURQEC template space, as distributed in the Mouse Brain Atlases Package \cite{atlases_generator}, version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{0.5.3}}), which is based on a high-resolution $\mathrm{T_2}$-weighted atlas \cite{dsu1}.
Controlled spatial smoothing was applied in the coronal plane up to \SI{250}{\micro\meter} via the AFNI package \cite{afni} (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{19.1.05}}).

The registered time course data was frequency filtered depending on the analysis workflow.
For stimulus-evoked activity, the data was low-pass filtered at a period threshold of \SI{225}{\second}, and for seed-based functional connectivity, the data was band-pass filtered within a period range of \SIrange{2}{225}{\second}.

\subsection{Statistics and Data}
Volumetric data was modelled using functions from the FSL software package \cite{fsl} (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{5.0.11}}).
First-level regression was applied to the temporally resolved volumetric data via FSL's \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{glm}} function, whereas the second-level analysis was applied to the first-level contrast and variance estimates via FSL's \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{flameo}}.

Stimulus-evoked first-level regression was performed using a convolution of the stimulus sequence with an opto-fMRI impulse response function, estimated by a beta fit of previously reported mouse opto-fMRI responses \cite{Grandjean2019}.
Seed-based functional connectivity analysis was performed by regressing the time course of the voxel most sensitive to the stimulus-evoked activity (per scan) in the VTA region of interest.

Brain parcellation for region-based evaluation was performed using a non-overlapping multi-center labelling \cite{dsu1,dsu2,dsu3,dsu4}, as distributed in version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{0.5.3}} of the Mouse Brain Atlases data package \cite{atlases_generator}.
The mapping operations were performed by a SAMRI function, using the nibabel \cite{nibabel} and nilearn \cite{nilearn} libraries (versions \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{2.3.1}} and \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{0.5.0}}, respectively).
Classification of implant coordinates into “best” and “rejected” categories was performed via 1D k-means clustering, implemented in the scikit-learn library \cite{scikit-learn} (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{0.20.3}}).
Distribution density visualizations were created using the Scott bandwidth density estimator \cite{Scott1979}, as implemented in the seaborn software package (\textcolor{mg}{\texttt{0.9.0}}).

Higher-level statistical modelling was performed with the Statsmodels software package \cite{statsmodels} (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{0.9.9}}), and the SciPy software package \cite{scipy} (version \textcolor{mg}{\texttt{1.1.0}}).
Model parameters were estimated using the ordinary least squares method, and a type 3 analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to control estimate variability for unbalanced categories.
All t-tests producing explicitly noted p-values are two-tailed.

The VTA structural projection data used to compare and contrast the activation maps produced in this study was sourced from the Allen Brain Institute (ABI) mouse brain connectome dataset \cite{abic}.
As the target promoter of this study (DAT) is not included in the ABI connectome study, all available promoters were used (Sty17, Erbb4, Slc6a3, Th, Cck, Pdzk1ip1, Chrna2, Hdc, Slc18a2, Calb2, and Rasgrf2).
Datasets with left-handed VTA injection sides were flipped to provide right-hand VTA projection estimates.
The data was converted and registered to the DSURQEC template space by the ABI Connectivity Data Generator package \cite{abic_g}.
For the second-level statistical comparison between functional activation and structural projection, individual activation (betas) and projection maps were normalized to a common scale by subtracting the average and dividing by the standard deviation.

Software management relevant for the exact reproduction of the aforementioned environment was performed via neuroscience package install instructions for the Gentoo Linux distribution \cite{ng}.
