\section{Methods}

\subsection{MR Acquisition}

Anatomical scans are acquired via a TurboRARE sequence, with a RARE factor of 8, an echo time (TE) of \SI{30}{\milli\second}, an inter-echo spacing of \SI{10}{\milli\second}, and a repetition time (TR) of \SI{2500}{\milli\second}, sampled at a sagittal and horizontal resolution of $\mathrm{\Delta x(\nu)=\Delta y(\phi)=\SI{75}{\micro\meter}}$, and a coronal resolution of $\mathrm{\Delta z(t)=\SI{450}{\micro\meter}}$.
Functional scans are acquired with a flip angle of \SI{60}{\degree} and with $\mathrm{TR/TE = \SI{1000}{\milli\second}/\SI{15}{\milli\second}}$ and $\mathrm{TR/TE = \SI{1000}{\milli\second}/\SI{5.5}{\milli\second}}$, respectively.
Functional scans are sampled at $\mathrm{\Delta x(\nu)=\Delta y(\phi)=\SI{225}{\micro\meter}}$, and $\mathrm{\Delta z(t)=\SI{450}{\micro\meter}}$ .
All aforementioned scans are acquired with a Bruker PharmaScan system (\SI{7}{\tesla}, \SI{16}{\centi\meter} bore), and an in-house T/R coil.

\subsection{Animal Preparation}

The measured animals were fitted with an optic fiber implant ($\mathrm{l=\SI{4.7}{\milli\meter} \ d=\SI{400}{\micro\meter}}$) targeting the right Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of the midbrain.
The nucleus was rendered sensitive to optical stimulation by transgenic expression of Cre recombinase under the Dopamine Transporter (DAT) promoter \cite{Scott2005} and viral injection of rAAVs delivering a plasmid with Cre-conditional expression of Channelrhodopsin and YFP ---
pAAV-EF1a-double floxed-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE-HGHpA, a gift from Karl Deisseroth (\href{https://www.addgene.org/20298/}{Addgene plasmid \#20298}).

The right side of the VTA was stimulated via an Omicron LuxX 488-60 laser (\SI{488}{\nano\meter}) tuned to \SI{30}{\milli\watt} at contact with the fiber implant, according to a series of protocols listed in \cref{tab:stim}.

\subsection{Statistics}
We perform statistical modelling with the Statsmodels \cite{statsmodels} package, and incrementally hone in on variance sources, as the qualitative modelling of our variables precludes robust estimation of high-order interaction terms.

\subsection{Reproducibility}

The source code for this document and all data analysis shown herein (including registration and QC workflow execution) is published according to the RepSeP specifications \cite{repsep}.
The data analysis execution and document compilation has been tested repeatedly on numerous machines, and as such we attest that all figures and statistics presented can be reproduced based solely on the raw data, dependency list, and analysis scripts which we distribute.
