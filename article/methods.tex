\section{The Optimized Workflow}
We perform statistical modelling with the Statsmodels \cite{statsmodels} package, and incrementally hone in on variance sources, as the qualitative modelling of our variables precludes robust estimation of high-order interaction terms.

\py{
        pytex_tab(inner_tabular=boilerplate.events_tab('data/CogB.tsv'),
                label='stim',
                caption='Stimulation protocol, as delivered during functional scans.',
                options_pre='[htp] \\scriptsize \\centering \\resizebox{\\columnwidth}{!}{',
                data='data/CogB.tsv',
                options_post='}',
                )
        }


\subsection{Reproducibility}

The source code for this document and all data analysis shown herein (including registration and QC workflow execution) is published according to the RepSeP specifications \cite{repsep}.
The data analysis execution and document compilation has been tested repeatedly on numerous machines, and as such we attest that all figures and statistics presented can be reproduced based solely on the raw data, dependency list, and analysis scripts which we distribute.
