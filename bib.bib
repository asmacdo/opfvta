	abstract = {Resting state-fMRI (rs-fMRI) in mice allows studying mechanisms underlying functional connectivity (FC) as well as alterations of FC occurring in murine models of neurological diseases. Mouse fMRI experiments are typically carried out under anesthesia to minimize animal movement and potential distress during examination. Yet, anesthesia inevitably affects FC patterns. Such effects have to be understood for proper interpretation of data. We have compared the influence of four commonly used anesthetics on rs-fMRI. Rs-fMRI data acquired under isoflurane, propofol, and urethane presented similar patterns when accounting for anesthesia depth. FC maps displayed bilateral correlation with respect to cortical seeds, but no significant inter-hemispheric striatal connectivity. In contrast, for medetomidine, we detected bilateral striatal but compromised inter-hemispheric cortical connectivity. The spatiotemporal patterns of the rs-fMRI signal have been rationalized considering anesthesia depth and pharmacodynamic properties of the anesthetics. Our results bridge the results from different studies from the burgeoning field of mouse rs-fMRI and offer a framework for understanding the influences of anesthetics on FC patterns. Utilizing this information, we suggest the combined use of medetomidine and isoflurane representing the two proposed classes of anesthetics; the combination of low doses of the two anesthetics retained strong correlations both within cortical and subcortical structures, without the potential seizure-inducing effects of medetomidine, rendering this regimen an attractive anesthesia for rs-fMRI in mice.},

	abstract = {Given the need for comparability across subjects and studies, the quality of registration to a standard space is crucial for the reliability of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and in particular functional MRI (fMRI). Present small animal MRI workflows fall short in terms of quality and reliability, commonly utilizing high-level scripts optimized for human data (adapting data to the scripts rather than vice-versa), and relying on interactive operator quality control (QC), which is infrequent, open to bias, slow, and unreproducible. In this fully reproducible article we showcase a novel mouse-brain-optimized workflow (accessible via Bash and Python), and a standard space suited to harmonize data between analysis and operation. We present four separate metrics for automated QC, and a visualization method to aid operator inspection. Benchmarking this workflow against common legacy practices (which we detail and comment) reveals that it performs more consistently, better preserves variance across subjects while minimizing variance across sessions, and improves volume conservation RMSE 2.8-fold, and smoothness conservation RMSE 2.9-fold. The {\textquotedblleft}SAMRI Generic{\textquotedblright} workflow sets a new standard for small animal MRI registration, ensuring robustness, comparability, and validity of region assignment.},
